Bruno has been an active and invested participant in the entrepreneurship program, both in class and in the practical work where students are involved in influencing the content taught according to the needs of student entrepreneurs. Bruno demonstrated an interest in entrepreneurship that the whole class could benefit from during the discussions on different business scenarios. He also demonstrated an obvious curiosity towards the tools of entrepreneurship and a strong desire to master their operation. It is therefore with pleasure that I refer Mr. Pettersen to any company."

The engine, which receives several million searches, had a flexible interface technology, but it was complex to integrate and limited response times.
