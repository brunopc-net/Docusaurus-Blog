## Engineering term

Even if I graduated from engineering school, I am **not** a professional enginner. I'm clarifying this because some of my mandates includes the term "Engineer" like SDET - Software Development Engineer in Test - and I don't want any trouble with [OIQ](https://www.oiq.qc.ca/en/). I wrote more about this topic here: [The Engineering term and its cascading mess](/blog/2023/10/13/Engineer-term-and-its-cascading-mess). 

I keep SDET in my job's experiences title to avoid misunderstandings of my expertise from potential employer/client, especially in the anglophone sphere, where job titles are mainly dictated from the U.S., where "Engineer" term is everywhere.
