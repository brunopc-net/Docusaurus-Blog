As I was debating at the time whether to pursue an MBA after my bachelor's degree, this condensed entrepreneurship minor provided me with a valuable opportunity to enhance my capabilities beyond my technical skills and gain extensive knowledge. I particularly enjoyed the marketing and management courses, as they helped broaden my understanding in those areas.
