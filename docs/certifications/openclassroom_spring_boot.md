Built my first React application step by step, enriching it with new features as I mastered the concepts.

Started by learning how React works and the JSX syntax with a simple online tool. Then created the foundations of a complete application with Create React App, to which I added style and content. The last part was an opportunity to discuss state and side effects, in order to make the application interactive for the user.
