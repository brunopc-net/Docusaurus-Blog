# About me

I live in Montreal, Canada. [I am a scientific mind in an athlete body](https://passionpvss.blogspot.com/2017/06/scientist-mind-athlete-body.html).

My <a href="/docs/category/experiences/" target="_blank"><ExperienceTotal/> years of work experience has been very diverse so far</a>, as I did development (software and web), but also worked as a DevOps, SDET and Application Support Analyst. In my last roles, I had my first experiences as a technical lead.

## Particularities

[I studied an entrepreneurship minor](/education/entrepreneurship-minor). I founded three distinct companies. I have dealt directly with clients multiple times.

All these experiences gave me a perspective that is lacking for a lot of folks with great technical skills.
It doesn't matter at all if you use the latest technologies avaiable if the project is a net profitability loss.
Of course the lastest trend will, most of the time, bring you faster developement and reduced maintenance time.
However, speed is the real goal. Not the technology itself. Sometimes, the latest DevOps tools or test automation just doesn't make sense.
I think a good Software Engineer should be able to precisely tune the work so it is best adapted to the context.

My business awareness, speed of work and pragmatism are what set me apart. IT has no value if it doesn't bring efficiency gains to people & organisations. 

## Interests

I am an accomplished athlete. I've been Speed skating for more then 20 years. [I'm a world recordman](https://www-rollerenligne-com.translate.goog/rencontre-avec-bruno-pettersen-coulombe-vainqueur-solo-des-24h-rollers-de-montreal-canada/?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp), as I traveled the most distance by skating within 24 hours. My passion has also made me a [published author on the subject](../static/files/Preview_Le_patinage_de_vitesse_courte_piste_2.pdf).

As for now, my current hobbies include kart and bike racing.
