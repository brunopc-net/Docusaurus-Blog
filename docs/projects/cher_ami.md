import MarkdownLink from '@site/src/components/link/MarkdownLink';

A Node.js email sender that runs as a DigitalOcean Serverless Function.

Named after [the most badass homing pigeon from World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher_Ami).

Used on my [Docusaurus Blog](/docs/projects/docusaurus_blog/) to allow email sending as it can't be done via frontend.
