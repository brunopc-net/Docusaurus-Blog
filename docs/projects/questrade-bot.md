# Questrade Bot

Bot stock buyer for Questrade. Deprecated.

<MarkdownLinkButton
  to='https://github.com/brunopc-net/QuestradeBot'
  text='Repository'
/>

I stopped this project because Questrade closed the write permissions for their API, so it is now impossible to automate the buying process unless relying on a sub-optimal solution like Selenium.

I since use https://passiv.com/ to *almost* automate my stock orders: I just need to click a button to confirm.
