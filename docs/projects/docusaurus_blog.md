## A markup based static website

Before my old web résumé, I was managing a self hosted Wordpress blog. The updates, plugins, security flaws, incompatibilities and slowness of the platform made it time consuming.

I was then planning a [blog/eboard running on Jekyll](https://github.com/brunopc-net/Jekyll-blog), and then I found Docusaurus. I was sold by:
1. The fact it is React based - availability of npm plugins
1. A great customizability (integration with [JSX/MDX](https://mdxjs.com/))
1. Future warranty - the fact that it is backed up by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook)
1. The [great developement momemtum](https://docusaurus.io/blog/tags/release)

It was also the perfect opportunity to practice my new react skills after following [my React course](/docs/certifications/openclassroom_start_with_react/).

## Json Resume

This is a much deserved improvement over [my previous web résumé](https://github.com/brunopc-net/Eboard)

With the addition of [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/), I was able to set a unique source of truth for my curriculum. All data for my blog [experiences](/docs/category/experiences/), [education](/docs/category/education/), [certifications](/docs/category/certifications/), [skills](/docs/about/#skills) and [my online résumé](https://registry.jsonresume.org/brunopc-net) is taken from that unique JSON file, which is a much faster way of maintaining it.
